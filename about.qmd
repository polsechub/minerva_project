Updating the project page so far

The AIS data is huge. So we now have chunked it into yearly raw data (with 2 hourly updates).

**Daily data:** We have utilized prio gridcells by counting all unique ships in a gridcell, for each day. For instance, grid-cell 138607 had 146 unique vessels on 2014/6/21, whereas grid-cell 129966 had only one unique ship movement on that day.

**Monthly**: We then count all daily unique ship movements in a month for each grid-cells, from January 2014 January to August 2022. Note that these are cumulative counts and note average, and there is a substantive variations among gridcells in the Gulf of Guinea (and therefore log transformed value is a better depiction in a figure). For instance, grid-cell 138607 had 4190 unique vessels on 2014/6, whereas grid-cell 129966 had only 31 unique ship movement on that month.

The following figures compare the raw two-hour updates of ship movements in the August 2014, with the aggregate monthly grid-cell data.

**Does piracy affect trade/ship movement? Analyzing grid-cell 135014**

Does the above data correlate with piracy events? Following figures depict piracy events that took place within the indicated month. One grid-cell where the number of piracy incidents vary is grid-cell 135014. Figure captions show the ship cumulative count and the average daily ship count for displayed month, for that grid-cell only (grid-cell 135014). After the last figure, the table displays the ship movement data for that grid-cell. IT is likely that the variation in ship movement is seasonal.

Piracy events are "Actual" events, and does not include "Attempted" (including attempted is slightly more noisy)

We do see some fluctuations in ship movements with piracy events, although it is not very clear. For instance, we see piracy in the month that has higher ship movement, which is what we argued in the Indonesian paper. But because we have monthly ship movement data, we are not able to ascertain whether ship movements are reduced in the short run, immediately after piracy.

It might be bit clearer if we scale this to weekly level.
